DogVCat

This is a school project and some analysis done is based on questions asked in the question paper. 
The main problem is a binary classification problem done on the classic dog vs cat image dataset. Choosing Chollet's Deep Learning workflow as a framework, I systematically try to use a model to solve the aforementioned problem.
